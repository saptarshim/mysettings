Checking and Correcting Spelling

This section describes the commands to check the spelling of a single word or of a portion
of a buffer. These commands only work if the spelling checker program Aspell, Ispell or 
Hunspell is installed. Aspell, Ispell or Hunspell are not part of Emacs, but one or the
other is usually installed in GNU/Linux and other free operating systems. See Aspell.

M-$   	 Check and correct spelling of the active region or the word at point (ispell-word). 
M-x ispell     Check and correct spelling in the active region or the entire buffer. 
M-x ispell-buffer    Check and correct spelling in the buffer. 
M-x ispell-region    Check and correct spelling in the region. 
M-x ispell-message   Check and correct spelling in a draft mail message, excluding cited material. 
M-x ispell-change-dictionary <RET> dict <RET>
Restart the Aspell/Ispell/Hunspell process, using dict as the dictionary. 
M-x ispell-kill-ispell
Kill the Aspell/Ispell/Hunspell subprocess. 
M-<TAB>
<ESC> <TAB>
Complete the word before point based on the spelling dictionary (ispell-complete-word). 
M-x flyspell-mode
Enable Flyspell mode, which highlights all misspelled words. 
M-x flyspell-prog-mode
Enable Flyspell mode for comments and strings only.

Testing VC

VC. I use Git for all my personal projects, and occasionally CVS and SVN for projects that I interact with. Emacs provides a package called VC which lets me perform many version control operations from within Emacs. It provides a layer of uniformity: the commands are all the same regardless of what version control system I am using for any particular project. This is great because it means that when bzr or hg or whatever comes into vogue, I can get quite a bit of work done before I have to learn yet another VCS.

Typical workflow for me: open a file. Make and test some changes. C-x v = to show a diff. If I like it, C-x v v to prepare a commit. Emacs pops up a new window in which to type a commit message. C-c C-c there to make the commit.

VC includes many other useful features, like showing annotated versions of files, showing change logs for particular files, and helping you review historical versions and diffs.
